/**
 * 592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction
 * 
 * Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. 
 * The final result should be irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, say 2, you need to change it to the format of fraction 
 * that has denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.

Example 1:
Input:"-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"
Example 2:
Input:"-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"
Example 3:
Input:"1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"
Example 4:
Input:"5/3+1/3"
Output: "2/1"
