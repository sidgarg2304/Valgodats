/**
 * 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
 * 
 * https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/68252/clarification-on-the-problem-
 * description-problem-description-need-to-be-updated/3
 * 
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * 
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is
 * higher or lower.
 * 
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay
 * $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * n = 10, I pick 8.
 * 
 * First round: You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 * 
 * Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 * 
 * Third round: You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 * 
 * Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 * 
 * You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21. Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how
 * much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
 * 
 * Hint:
 * 
 * The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could
 * possibly face. Another strategy is to minimize the expected loss. Here, we
 * are interested in the first scenario.
 * 
 * Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
 * 
 * Check out this article if you're still stuck.
 * 
 * The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a
 * small n. You MUST use dynamic programming. As a follow-up, how would you
 * modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss,
 * instead of the worst-case loss?

	 * Clarification on the problem description. [Problem description need to be
	 * updated !!! ] It is actually confusing that the example shown in the
	 * problem description is not the best stragety to guess the final target
	 * number, and the problem itself is asking for the lowest cost achieved by
	 * best guessing strategy. The example description should be updated.
	 * 
	 * ---POSSIBLY, it can also add some example about the BEST Strategy--- The
	 * example description should be:
	 * 
	 * first introducebest strategyto guess:
	 * 
	 * for one number, like 1, best strategy is 0$
	 * 
	 * for two number, like 3,4, best strategy is 3$, which can be understood in
	 * this way: you have two way to guess: a) start by guess 4 is the target,
	 * (the worst case is) if wrong, you get charged $4, then immediately you
	 * know 3 is the target number, get get charged $0 by guessing that, and
	 * finally you get charged $4. b) similarly, if you start by 3, (the worst
	 * case is) if wrong, you get charged $3, then you immediately know that 4 is
	 * the target number, and get charged $0 for guessing this, and finally you
	 * get charged $3. In summary: range ---------> best strategy cost 3, 4
	 * ---------> $3 5, 6 ---------> $5 ...
	 * 
	 * for three number, the best strategy is guess the middle number first, and
	 * (worst case is) if wrong, you get charged that middle number money, and
	 * then you immediately know what target number is by using "lower" or
	 * "higher" response, so in summary: range ---------> best strategy cost 3,
	 * 4, 5 ---------> $4 7, 8, 9 ---------> $8 ...
	 * 
	 * for more numbers, it can simply be reduced them into smaller ranges, and
	 * here is why DP solution make more sense in solving this. suppose the range
	 * is [start, end] the strategy here is to iterate through all number
	 * possible and select it as the starting point, say for any k between start
	 * and end, the worst cost for this is: k+DP( start, k-1 ) + DP(k+1, end ),
	 * and the goal is minimize the cost, so you need the minimum one among all
	 * those k between start and end
