/**
 * 274. H-Index
 *
 *Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:

An easy approach is to sort the array first.
What are the possible values of h-index?
A faster approach is to use extra space.

   /**
	 * This type of problems always throw me off, but it just takes some getting
	 * used to. The idea behind it is some bucket sort mechanisms. First, you may
	 * ask why bucket sort. Well, the h-index is defined as the number of papers
	 * with reference greater than the number. So assume n is the total number of
	 * papers, if we have n+1 buckets, number from 0 to n, then for any paper
	 * with reference corresponding to the index of the bucket, we increment the
	 * count for that bucket. The only exception is that for any paper with
	 * larger number of reference than n, we put in the n-th bucket.
	 * 
	 * Then we iterate from the back to the front of the buckets, whenever the
	 * total count exceeds the index of the bucket, meaning that we have the
	 * index number of papers that have reference greater than or equal to the
	 * index. Which will be our h-index result. The reason to scan from the end
	 * of the array is that we are looking for the greatest h-index. For example,
	 * given array [3,0,6,5,1], we have 6 buckets to contain how many papers have
	 * the corresponding index. Hope to image and explanation help.
	 *
