/**
 * 469. Convex Polygon
 * 
 * Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if
 * this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon).
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 1. There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
 * 
 * 2. Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
 * 
 * 3. You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple
 * polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly
 * two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect
 * each other. Example 1:
 * 
 * [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
 * 
 * Answer: True
