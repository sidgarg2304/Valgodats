/**
 * 845. Longest Mountain in Array
 * 
 * Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:

B.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < B.length - 1 such that B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]
(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain. 

Return 0 if there is no mountain.

Example 1:

Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
Note:

0 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10000

	 * Approach #1: Two Pointer [Accepted]
Intuition

Without loss of generality, a mountain can only start after the previous one ends.

This is because if it starts before the peak, it will be smaller than a mountain starting previous; and it is impossible to start after the peak.

Algorithm

For a starting index base, let's calculate the length of the longest mountain A[base], A[base+1], ..., A[end].

If such a mountain existed, the next possible mountain will start at base = end; if it didn't, then either we reached the end, or we have A[base] > A[base+1] and we can start at base + 1.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)O(N), where NN is the length of A.

Space Complexity: O(1)O(1).
