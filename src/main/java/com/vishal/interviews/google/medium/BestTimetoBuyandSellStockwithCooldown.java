 * 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
 * 
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
 * on day i.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock
 * multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 * 
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must
 * sell the stock before you buy again). After you sell your stock, you cannot
 * buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day) Example:
 * 
 * prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
 * 
 * maxProfit = 3
 * 
 * transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
 *

	 * The series of problems are typical dp. The key for dp is to find the
	 * variables to represent the states and deduce the transition function.
	 * 
	 * Of course one may come up with a O(1) space solution directly, but I think
	 * it is better to be generous when you think and be greedy when you
	 * implement.
	 * 
	 * The natural states for this problem is the 3 possible transactions : buy,
	 * sell, rest. Here rest means no transaction on that day (aka cooldown).
	 * 
	 * Then the transaction sequences can end with any of these three states.
	 * 
	 * For each of them we make an array, buy[n], sell[n] and rest[n].
	 * 
	 * buy[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with
	 * buy.
	 * 
	 * sell[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with
	 * sell.
	 * 
	 * rest[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with
	 * rest.
	 * 
	 * Then we want to deduce the transition functions for buy sell and rest. By
	 * definition we have:
	 * 
	 * buy[i] = max(rest[i-1]-price, buy[i-1]) sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price,
	 * sell[i-1]) rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1]) Where price is
	 * the price of day i. All of these are very straightforward. They simply
	 * represents :
	 * 
	 * (1) We have to `rest` before we `buy` and (2) we have to `buy` before we
	 * `sell` One tricky point is how do you make sure you sell before you buy,
	 * since from the equations it seems that [buy, rest, buy] is entirely
	 * possible.
	 * 
	 * Well, the answer lies within the fact that buy[i] <= rest[i] which means
	 * rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], rest[i-1]). That made sure [buy, rest, buy] is
	 * never occurred.
	 * 
	 * A further observation is that and rest[i] <= sell[i] is also true
	 * therefore
	 * 
	 * rest[i] = sell[i-1] Substitute this in to buy[i] we now have 2 functions
	 * instead of 3:
	 * 
	 * buy[i] = max(sell[i-2]-price, buy[i-1]) sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price,
	 * sell[i-1]) This is better than 3, but
	 * 
	 * we can do even better
	 * 
	 * Since states of day i relies only on i-1 and i-2 we can reduce the O(n)
	 * space to O(1). And here we are at our final solution:
	 * 
	 * @param prices
	 * @return

	/**
	 * Easiest JAVA solution with explanations Here I share my no brainer weapon
	 * when it comes to this kind of problems.
	 * 
	 * 1. Define States
	 * 
	 * To represent the decision at index i:
	 * 
	 * buy[i]: Max profit till index i. The series of transaction is ending with
	 * a buy. sell[i]: Max profit till index i. The series of transaction is
	 * ending with a sell. To clarify:
	 * 
	 * Till index i, the buy / sell action must happen and must be the last
	 * action. It may not happen at index i. It may happen at i - 1, i - 2, ...
	 * 0. In the end n - 1, return sell[n - 1]. Apparently we cannot finally end
	 * up with a buy. In that case, we would rather take a rest at n - 1. For
	 * special case no transaction at all, classify it as sell[i], so that in the
	 * end, we can still return sell[n - 1].
	 * 
	 * 2. Define Recursion
	 * 
	 * buy[i]: To make a decision whether to buy at i, we either take a rest, by
	 * just using the old decision at i - 1, or sell at/before i - 2, then buy at
	 * i, We cannot sell at i - 1, then buy at i, because of cooldown. sell[i]:
	 * To make a decision whether to sell at i, we either take a rest, by just
	 * using the old decision at i - 1, or buy at/before i - 1, then sell at i.
	 * So we get the following formula:
	 * 
	 * buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 2] - prices[i]); sell[i] =
	 * Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i]); 3. Optimize to O(1) Space
	 * 
	 * DP solution only depending on i - 1 and i - 2 can be optimized using O(1)
	 * space.
	 * 
	 * Let b2, b1, b0 represent buy[i - 2], buy[i - 1], buy[i] Let s2, s1, s0
	 * represent sell[i - 2], sell[i - 1], sell[i] Then arrays turn into
	 * Fibonacci like recursion:
	 * 
	 * b0 = Math.max(b1, s2 - prices[i]); s0 = Math.max(s1, b1 + prices[i]); 4.
	 * Write Code in 5 Minutes
	 * 
	 * First we define the initial states at i = 0:
	 * 
	 * We can buy. The max profit at i = 0 ending with a buy is -prices[0]. We
	 * cannot sell. The max profit at i = 0 ending with a sell is 0.
	 * 
	 * @param prices
	 * @return

	/**
	 * Very Easy to Understand One Pass O(n) Solution with No Extra Space The
	 * idea is as follows:
	 * 
	 * First, think about what we can do on day i? You either have one stock or
	 * you don't on day i. For each case, you have two options, making a total of
	 * four possible actions on day i:
	 * 
	 * you have 1 stock and you sell it
	 * 
	 * you have 1 stock and you do nothing
	 * 
	 * you have 0 stock and you buy stock i
	 * 
	 * you have 0 stock and you do nothing
	 * 
	 * As you can imagine, these four actions are correlated between day i-1 and
	 * day i. For example,
	 * 
	 * if you take action 1 on day i, you then have either taken action 2 or 3 on
	 * day i-1 but not 1 or 4. In precise, two consecutive days are related as
	 * follows:
	 * 
	 * if you take action 1 on day i ==> you have either taken action 2 or 3 on
	 * day i-1
	 * 
	 * if you take action 2 on day i ==> you have either taken action 2 or 3 on
	 * day i-1
	 * 
	 * if you take action 3 on day i ==> you must have taken action 4 on day i-1
	 * (you can not sell on day i-1 due to cool down)
	 * 
	 * if you take action 4 on day i ==> you have either taken action 1 or 4 on
	 * day i-1
	 * 
	 * Now you want to maximize your total profit, but you don't know what action
	 * to take on day i such that you get the total maximum profit, so you try
	 * all 4 actions on every day. Suppose you take action 1 on day i, since
	 * there are two possible actions on day i-1, namely actions 2 and 3, you
	 * would definitely choose the one that makes your profit on day i more. Same
	 * thing for actions 2 and 4. So we now have an iterative algorithm.
	 * 
	 * Before coding, one detail to emphasize is that the initial value on day 0
	 * is important. You basically cannot take action 1, so the corresponding
	 * profits should be 0. You cannot take action 2 in practice, but you cannot
	 * set up the profit to 0, because that means you don't have a stock to sell
	 * on day 1. Therefore, the initial profit should be negative value of the
	 * first stock. You can also think of it as you buy the stock on day -1 and
	 * do nothing on day 0.
	 * 
	 * @param prices
	 * @return
