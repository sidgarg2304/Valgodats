/**
 * 
 * 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
 * 
 * Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

/**
 * Proper O(1) space I've seen several solutions claimed to be O(1) space, but I
 * disagree. They traverse the tree in in-order and keep track of the current
 * set of modes (among other things). But that's not O(1) space, not even when
 * disregarding recursion stack space (as explicitly allowed) and result space
 * (not mentioned but reasonable). The set's contents aren't on stack space, so
 * it can't be disregarded that way. And if the values are for example
 * 1,2,3,4,...,n-2,n-1,n-1 (unique values followed by one double value), the set
 * grows to Î©(n) and it can't be disregarded because the result only has size 1.
 * 
 * I think the way to do it properly is to do two passes. One to find the
 * highest number of occurrences of any value, and then a second pass to collect
 * all values occurring that often. Any other ideas?
 * 
 * Here's a (two-pass) solution that I think can rightfully be called O(1)
 * space. Both passes keep track of the current value etc, and the second pass
 * additionally collects the modes in the result array. I took the value
 * handling out of the in-order traversal into its own function for clarity.
 * Also, this way you could very easily replace my recursive in-order traversal
 * with for example Morris traversal. Then you wouldn't even need to disregard
 * the recursion stack space in order to claim O(1) extra space usage.
