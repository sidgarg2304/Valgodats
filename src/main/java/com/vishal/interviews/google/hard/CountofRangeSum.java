	 * Now let's do better than this.
	 * 
	 * Recall count smaller number after self where we encountered the problem
	 * 
	 * count[i] = count of nums[j] - nums[i] < 0 with j > i
	 * 
	 * Here, after we did the preprocess, we need to solve the problem
	 * 
	 * count[i] = count of a <= S[j] - S[i] <= b with j > i
	 * 
	 * ans = sum(count[:])
	 * 
	 * Therefore the two problems are almost the same. We can use the same
	 * technique used in that problem to solve this problem. One solution is
	 * merge sort based; another one is Balanced BST based. The time complexity
	 * are both O(n log n).
	 * 
	 * The merge sort based solution counts the answer while doing the merge.
	 * During the merge stage, we have already sorted the left half [start, mid)
	 * and right half [mid, end). We then iterate through the left half with
	 * index i. For each i, we need to find two indices k and j in the right half
	 * where
	 * 
	 * j is the first index satisfy sums[j] - sums[i] > upper and
	 * 
	 * k is the first index satisfy sums[k] - sums[i] >= lower.
	 * 
	 * Then the number of sums in [lower, upper] is j-k. We also use another
	 * index t to copy the elements satisfy sums[t] < sums[i] to a cache in order
	 * to complete the merge sort.
	 * 
	 * Despite the nested loops, the time complexity of the "merge & count" stage
	 * is still linear. Because the indices k, j, t will only increase but not
	 * decrease, each of them will only traversal the right half once at most.
	 * The total time complexity of this divide and conquer solution is then O(n
	 * log n).
	 * 
	 * One other concern is that the sums may overflow integer. So we use long
	 * instead.

	/**
	 * Summary of the Divide and Conquer based and Binary Indexed Tree based
	 * solutions Thanks for those contributing excellent ideas to this problem.
	 * Here is a quick summary of solutions based on either divide and conquer or
	 * binary indexed tree.
	 * 
	 * To start, we already know there is a straightforward solution by computing
	 * each range sum and checking whether it lies in [lower, upper] or not. If
	 * the number of elements is n, we have n*(n+1)/2 such range sums so the
	 * naive solution will end up with O(n^2) time complexity. Now we are asked
	 * to do better than that. So what are the targeted time complexities in your
	 * mind? When I first looked at the problem, my instinct is that O(n)
	 * solution is too ambitious, so I will target at linearithmic-like
	 * (O(n*(logn)^b)) solutions. To get the logarithmic part, it's natural to
	 * think of breaking down the original array, and that's where the
	 * divide-and-conquer idea comes from.
	 * 
	 * For this problem, we need some array to apply our divide and conquer
	 * algorithm. Without much thinking, we can do that directly with the input
	 * array (nums) itself. Since our problem also involves range sums and I
	 * believe you have the experience of computing range sums from prefix array
	 * of the input array, we might as well apply divide and conquer ideas on the
	 * prefix array. So I will give both the input-array based and prefix-array
	 * based divide&conquer solutions.
	 * 
	 * Let's first look at input-array based divide&conquer solution. Our
	 * original problem is like this: given an input array nums with length n and
	 * a range [lower, upper], find the total number of range sums that lie in
	 * the given range. Note the range [lower, upper] and the input array are
	 * both fixed. Therefore each range sum can be characterized by two indices
	 * i1 and i2 (i1 <= i2), such that range sum S(i1, i2) is the summation of
	 * input elements with indices going from i1 up to i2 (both inclusive). Then
	 * our problem can be redefined in terms of the value ranges of i1 and i2.
	 * For example our original problem can be restated as finding the total
	 * number of range sums lying in the given range with 0 <= i1 <= i2 <= n - 1,
	 * or in a symbolic way T(0, n-1).
	 * 
	 * Now if we break our original input array into two subarrays, [0, m] and
	 * [m+1, n-1] with m = (n-1)/2, our original problem can be divided into
	 * three parts, depending on the values of i1 and i2. If i1 and i2 are both
	 * from the first subarray [0, m], we have a subproblem T(0, m); if i1 and i2
	 * are both from the second subarray, we have a subproblem T(m+1, n-1); if i1
	 * is from the first subarray and i2 from the second (note we assume i1 <=
	 * i2, therefore we don't have the other case with i2 from first subarray and
	 * i1 from second), then we have a new problem which I define as C. In
	 * summary we should have:
	 * 
	 * T(0, n-1) = T(0, m) + T(m+1, n-1) + C
	 * 
	 * Now from the master theorem, the time complexity of the new problem C
	 * should be better than O(n^2), otherwise we make no improvement by applying
	 * this divide&conquer idea. So again, I will aim at linearithmic-like
	 * solutions for the new problem C: find the total number of range sums lying
	 * in the given range with each range sum starting from the first subarray
	 * and ending at the second subarray.
	 * 
	 * First let's try to compute all such range sums. The way I did it was first
	 * computing the prefix array of the second subarray and the suffix array (or
	 * "backward" prefix array if you like) of the first subarray. Then I can
	 * naively add each element in the suffix array to all elements in the prefix
	 * array to obtain all the possible range sums. Of course you end up with
	 * O(n^2) solution, as expected. So how can we approach it with better time
	 * complexity?
	 * 
	 * Here are the facts I observed: for each element e in the suffix array, we
	 * need to add it to all elements in the prefix array. But the order in which
	 * we add it doesn't matter. This implies that we can sort our prefix array.
	 * This can be done in O(nlogn) time. Now we have a sorted prefix array, do
	 * we still need to add the element e to all elements in the prefix array?
	 * The answer is no. Because our final goal is to compare the resulted range
	 * sums with the given range bounds lower and upper. It is equivalent to
	 * modifying the range bounds so we have new bounds (lower - e) and (upper -
	 * e) and leave the prefix array unchanged. Now we can compare these new
	 * bounds with the sorted prefix array, and I'm sure you can write your own
	 * binary search algorithm to do that. So for each element e in the suffix
	 * array, we can compute the modified range bounds and get the number of
	 * range sums in this new range in logn time. Therefore the total time will
	 * be O(nlogn). So in summary, our new problem C can be solved in O(nlogn)
	 * time and according to the master theorem, our original problem can be
	 * solved in O(n(logn)^2) time. The following is the complete java program:
	 * 
	 * @param nums
	 * @param lower
	 * @param upper
